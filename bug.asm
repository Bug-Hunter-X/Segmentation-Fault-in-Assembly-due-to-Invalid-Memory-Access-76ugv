```assembly
mov eax, [ebx+0x10]
add eax, ecx
mov [edi], eax
```
This code snippet has a potential bug related to memory access.  If the value in `ebx + 0x10` points to an invalid memory address or if the memory at that location is not readable, it will result in a segmentation fault or access violation.
